        <!-- '#main-wrap' will be a container for our entire layout.
             Since "block level" elements inherit the width of their parent,
             all of the child 'block elements' of #main-wrap will inherit the width of what we define here.

             This gives us the flexibility to change the overall width of our layout without much work.

             It also allows us to easily position everything to the center of the page.

             e.g css:
                #main-wrap {
                    width: 960px;
                    margin: 0 auto;
                }
        -->
        <div id="main-wrap">
            <!--
                The '#header' contains other elements and inherits the width of it's parent.
                It has no elements to the left or right. Because of this, it's a great candidate
                for a block level element.
            -->
            <div id="header">
                <h3>Make a post</h3>

                <!--
                    Inline elements will flow horizontally by default, and because they come after a block element,
                    they will start on a new line (underneath the element above).
                 -->
                <input type="text">
                <button>Submit</button>
            </div>

            <!--
                '.post-wrap' will contain our two column layout and should inherit the width of the parent.
                Since this block will be repeated for each post, we use a class as an id.
            -->
            <div class="post-wrap">
                <!--
                    Since we want a two column layout, let's use the layout trick where we float
                    the '.left-col' to the left, give it a width, and then the right column ('.post-msg') will have
                    a margin-left set in order to offset it (to account for the left column).

                    Remember, when we add border or padding to the left-col, we have to adjust our margin left
                    to account for that as well.

                    e.g. css:
                        .left-col {
                            width: 200px;
                            float: left;
                        }

                        .post-body {
                            margin-left: 200px;
                        }
                -->
                <div class="left-col">
                    <div class="img">IMG</div>
                    <h2>Billy Bastard</h2>
                    <h3>Front End Ninja</h3>

                <div class="post-body">

                    <span class="close">X</span>
                </div>
            </div>
